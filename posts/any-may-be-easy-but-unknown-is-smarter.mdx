TypeScript‚Äôs `any` type often seems like a quick fix when dealing with dynamic or unknown values. It removes type errors, allows us to write code quickly, and gives us full flexibility‚Äîbut that‚Äôs also exactly why it‚Äôs dangerous.

A better alternative? **`unknown`**. While `unknown` might require a little more effort, it enforces better practices, reduces runtime errors, and helps maintain code safety in the long run.

Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into why `unknown` should be your default choice over `any` and how it can make your code more reliable.

## **The Pitfalls of `any`**

When you use `any`, TypeScript essentially turns off its type-checking mechanisms for that value. It allows you to do anything with the variable‚Äî**even things that make no sense**.

Consider the following example:

```typescript
let data: any = "Hello, world!";

// TypeScript allows this, but it will cause a runtime error
console.log(data.toFixed(2)); // ‚ùå Uncaught TypeError: data.toFixed is not a function
```

Because `data` is typed as `any`, TypeScript assumes we know what we‚Äôre doing and lets us call `.toFixed(2)`, even though `data` is actually a string.

The problem? This code compiles without errors, but it **crashes at runtime**.

### **Losing Type Safety**

Another issue with `any` is that once a variable is typed as `any`, **TypeScript stops tracking its structure**, leading to subtle and hard-to-debug issues.

```typescript
let user: any = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };

console.log(user.address.street); // ‚ùå No compile-time error, but crashes at runtime
```

Here, TypeScript doesn‚Äôt warn us that `user.address` doesn‚Äôt exist because `user` is typed as `any`.

This becomes especially dangerous in large applications, where unexpected `undefined` or `null` values can sneak in and cause unpredictable behavior.

## **How `unknown` Fixes These Issues**

Unlike `any`, **`unknown` still provides flexibility but enforces type checking** before you can use the value.

Let‚Äôs rewrite our previous example using `unknown`:

```typescript
let data: unknown = "Hello, world!";

// TypeScript enforces type checking
if (typeof data === "number") {
  console.log(data.toFixed(2)); // ‚úÖ Safe, only runs if data is a number
} else {
  console.log("Data is not a number"); // ‚úÖ Prevents runtime errors
}
```

Here, we explicitly check the type of `data` before using it. If `data` is not a number, we handle it gracefully instead of causing a crash.

### **Ensuring Type Safety**

Let‚Äôs take our `user` object example and see how `unknown` enforces better practices:

```typescript
let user: unknown = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };

// TypeScript enforces explicit type checking
if (typeof user === "object" && user !== null && "address" in user) {
  console.log((user as { address: { street: string } }).address.street);
} else {
  console.log("Address information is missing");
}
```

Now, TypeScript **forces** us to check if `user` actually contains `address` before we access it. This eliminates the risk of `undefined` property errors.---

## **Working with `unknown` in Functions**

A common use case for `any` is when handling API responses or dynamically typed data. Let‚Äôs see how `unknown` improves safety in such scenarios.

### **Using `any` in a Function**

```typescript
function parseJson(json: string): any {
  return JSON.parse(json);
}

const user = parseJson('{"name": "Alice"}');

console.log(user.name.toUpperCase()); // ‚ùå Possible runtime error if name is missing
```

This function **trusts that JSON.parse() will return exactly what we expect**, which isn‚Äôt always true. If the JSON is malformed or missing keys, this can easily break.

### **Using `unknown` for Safer Parsing**

```typescript
function parseJsonSafe(json: string): unknown {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(json);
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}

const user = parseJsonSafe('{"name": "Alice"}');

// Enforcing explicit checks
if (typeof user === "object" && user !== null && "name" in user) {
  console.log((user as { name: string }).name.toUpperCase()); // ‚úÖ Safe
} else {
  console.log("Invalid JSON data");
}
```

## By using `unknown`, we are forced to **validate** that `user` is an object and contains the expected properties before using them.

## **Using `unknown` with Generics**

When working with generics, `unknown` allows you to create more flexible yet safe abstractions.

### **Example: Fetching API Data**

Instead of using `any`, we can leverage `unknown` in a generic function:

```typescript
async function fetchData<T = unknown>(url: string): Promise<T> {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return response.json();
}

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

async function getUser() {
  const user = await fetchData<User>("https://api.example.com/user");

  // TypeScript now enforces that user has name and age properties
  console.log(user.name.toUpperCase());
}
```

Here, `fetchData<T>` defaults to `unknown`, ensuring that when fetching data, the caller **must** define the expected type structure.---

## **When is `any` Still Useful?**

Despite its issues, `any` **isn‚Äôt entirely evil**‚Äîthere are a few cases where using `any` is still acceptable:

1. **Gradual Migration from JavaScript**

   - If you‚Äôre incrementally converting a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, `any` can act as a temporary placeholder.

2. **Third-Party Libraries with No Type Definitions**

   - Sometimes, external libraries don‚Äôt provide TypeScript types. Using `any` can be a workaround:

   ```typescript
   declare const legacyLibrary: any;
   ```

3. **Quick Prototyping**
   - When you need to test concepts without worrying about strict type enforcement. Just make sure to replace `any` later.---

## **Final Thoughts: Use `unknown` by Default**

While `any` might seem like an easy shortcut, **it‚Äôs a trap** that removes type safety and increases the risk of runtime errors.

By defaulting to `unknown`, you:  
‚úÖ **Ensure type safety**  
‚úÖ **Prevent accidental property access errors**  
‚úÖ **Force proper type checks**

The next time you reach for `any`, ask yourself:

> **‚ÄúCan I use `unknown` instead and make my code safer?‚Äù**
