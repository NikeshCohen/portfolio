AI has changed the way we write code. Tools like **Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini** can generate entire functions, refactor messy code, and even build small applications. But what happens when the project scales beyond a few files?

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1ibtjri/my_project_became_so_big_that_claude_cant/) from a developer who relied entirely on **AI-generated code** sheds light on a key issue: **AI is great at writing code, but it struggles with long-term project maintenance.**

## The Experiment: A 30-File AI-Generated Project

The user in question built a **Python project with over 30 files** using **Claude and Cursor**. Initially, everything seemed to work fine. But as the project grew:

- **Claude started forgetting imports**
- **Duplicate logic appeared across multiple files**
- **Bug fixes led to broken functionality**
- **It struggled to optimize code properly**

### Why Does AI Struggle With Maintenance?

Large-scale software development isn’t just about writing code—it’s about **managing complexity.**

1. **Context Limitations** – Most AI models have a fixed context window. They don’t persist memory between interactions, meaning they **lose track of how different files interact.**

2. **No Project-Level Awareness** – AI operates within **isolated chunks** of code. Unlike a developer who understands the entire architecture, AI lacks a **holistic view** of the system.

3. **Surface-Level Fixes** – AI-generated bug fixes often don’t address **root causes**. Instead of refactoring properly, the model **deletes lines, introduces new errors, or produces redundant logic.**

## AI Struggles Even With "Small" Projects

Let’s be clear—**30 files is not a large codebase.** Many real-world applications have **hundreds or thousands** of files. If AI is already struggling at this scale, **full AI-driven development is still a long way off.**

### What Can You Do?

Instead of relying on AI to “fix” an entire project, consider a **guided approach**:

✅ **Break down tasks**  
Instead of asking AI to fix "the entire project," request **specific changes** in individual files.

✅ **Improve context**  
Provide relevant **source files** when asking AI to generate or modify code.

✅ **Refactor manually**  
AI can assist, but **human review is critical.** Ensure that refactored code aligns with best practices.

## AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement

AI **accelerates development**, but it’s **not a substitute for software engineering skills.** If you don’t understand what AI-generated code does, **you’re not writing code—you’re just hoping it works.**
